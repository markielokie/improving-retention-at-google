# Improving Retention at Google

This contains my research design proposal for APAN5300 Research Design course at Columbia University

My research experiment is seeking to answer whether a raise in yearly increment percentages would improve the tenures of Google software engineers. The outcomes of this experiment would allow formation of new HR policies to alleviate the ubiquitous attrition problems that plague the tech industry

The research proposal includes the literature review, research plan and simulation of effects (using R)
